# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Challenge 18


With its ability to analyze data and make accurate predictions, it has become an indispensable tool for many financial institutions. In particular, it has been used to assess credit risk and determine the eligibility of potential users for loans.

The use of Machine Learning has brought many benefits to the world of finance. For one, it has made the loan experience quicker and more reliable. With the use of statistical algorithms, financial institutions can quickly and accurately assess a borrower's creditworthiness, making the loan application process more efficient.

In addition, Machine Learning has allowed for more accurate selection of candidates for credit loans. By analyzing data patterns, financial institutions can identify individuals who are more likely to pay back their loans, while also identifying those who may be a higher risk.

One recent project that showcased the power of Machine Learning in FinTech involved the analysis of credit card risk. The project utilized a dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, to evaluate the performance of six different Machine Learning algorithms. As credit card risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, the team had to carefully evaluate which algorithm would perform the best with the specific data.

After performing a thorough evaluation, the team was able to determine which algorithm provided the best performance. The results showed that the Random Forest algorithm provided the highest accuracy in predicting credit card risk. This algorithm was able to accurately predict risky loans with a precision of 0.80, while also correctly identifying good loans with a recall of 0.90.

Overall, the project demonstrated the power of Machine Learning in the world of finance. With its ability to quickly and accurately assess credit risk, it has become an indispensable tool for many financial institutions. As technology continues to advance, it will be exciting to see how Machine Learning will continue to revolutionize the world of finance and make financial services more accessible and efficient for all.

The Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier achieved the highest performance with an accuracy score of 92%. After evaluating the training and test datasets, it became evident that this algorithm outperformed the other models. In my opinion, the results obtained from the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier were significantly superior to those of the other models.
